Machine Learning Notes

## Why?
Machine Learning knowledges is complex. Building a machine learning programe often requires the understanding of the algorithms and coding skills.
When I'm learning machine learning, I found the pieces of the knowledge online is quite fragmented. It's both important and highly efficient to organize those pieces for me.
So I decided to write down what I've learned throughout my journey to the ##Artificial Intelligiance##.
It might be a great scenary on the road, but more likely to encounter lots of chanllenges.
